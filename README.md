MNIST Digit Classification using Keras/TensorFlow

Here, I have tried to build and trained a fully-connected neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) with ~94.6% accuracy. I preprocessed 60,000 training dataset for optimal model input by normalizing the data and deployed the trained model to make predictions on unseen 10,000 testing dataset.
